2. About Me

A dual-degree B.Tech + B.Sc student who started as the introverted, two-movies-a-day guy and somehow ended up organizing massive tech events, winning hackathons on streak, and building systems people actually use. I like solving problems that punch back—operating systems, AI pipelines, NFC infrastructure, system design, and hackathon chaos.

I believe in the 1% mentality: learn faster, build faster, ship better. My work blends creativity, sarcasm, and that student-chaos energy that turns ideas into functioning prototypes at 3 AM.

I don’t chase clout. I chase craft.

3. Skills & Tech Stack
Programming Languages

Java, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, SQL

Frameworks & Libraries

Flask, TensorFlow, GANs, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib

Tools & Platforms

Git, Docker, Termux Linux, Jupyter, Linux (Ubuntu), Razorpay API, SQLite, VS Code

Core Concepts

Operating Systems, Page Replacement, Banker’s Algorithm, Deadlocks, Producer-Consumer, Memory Allocation, Graph Theory, Automata Theory, Turing Machines, Probability & Statistics, ML model training, Embedded systems (Ultrasonic sensors + Servo)

4. Experience
Languify.ai – Intern

2025

Worked on real-world tech tasks and design implementations.

Improved problem-solving speed across API design, debugging, and system-level thinking.

Event Organizer (Campus)

Led and executed large-scale events within one week.

Managed operations, logistics, and team coordination.

Brought structure into absolute chaos.

Many more roles and internships.
worked under an us based company and built solutions to real world problems faced by a company(automations using playwright, selenium, python and n8n)

5. Projects
HEALIO – AI-Driven Early Disease Detection

Role: Full-stack + ML
Problem: Detect diseases before symptoms become irreversible.
Features:

Patient & doctor registration

Appointment system

ML-based symptom-to-disease prediction

Alerts & anomaly detection
Tech: Flask, SQLite, ML models
What you learned: System design, medical workflows, early detection logic.

ByteCoins – NFC-Based Payment System

Role: Full-stack backend + system architecture
Problem: Create an NFC payment system for real-money transactions within college.
Features:

Admin-only NFC writing

User-only NFC reading

Razorpay integration

Role-based access control

Secure token handling
Tech: Java, NFC, Razorpay API
What you learned: Tokenization, access control, financial flow logic.

Graph Theory Assignment Suite

DFS, BFS, Topological Sort, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, MST, negative cycle detection.
Converted multiple C OS programs to Python equivalents.
Used for competitive prep + academic mastery.

GAN-Based AI Art Generator (Hackathon Project)

Role: ML Developer
Problem: Build an AI art generator from scratch using TensorFlow + GANs.
Status: Completed (3050 GPU).
What you learned: GAN architectures, CUDA tooling, image generation pipelines.

Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection System (Real-Time)

Role: Embedded developer
System: Ultrasonic + servo motor + terminal-based visualization
Outcome: A real-time sweep-scanning obstacle detection setup.

HireHub – Workforce Micro-Matching System

SE Project (Idea Implementation)
Abstract: A system that connects large companies needing temporary, small-volume manpower with workers ready for single-event or short-duration tasks.
Problem Statement: Lack of centralized infrastructure for micro-duration manpower requirements leads to inefficiency for both companies and workers.
